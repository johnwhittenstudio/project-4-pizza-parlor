## by _**John Whitten**_

### _December 11, 2021_

#### _This is a web-based application wherein the user can order a pizza, select various toppings and sizes, and receive an order confirmation._

## Technologies Used

- _HTML_
- _CSS_
- _Bootstrap_
- _Javascript_
- _jQuery-3.6.0_

## Project Title: Pizza Parlor

## Description

#### _This is the fourth independent project for Epicodus._

#### _Project Prompt: Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost._

- _Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order._
- _Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size._
- _Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this. Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes._

## Project Objectives

- _Constructors and prototypes are used successfully._

- _Application works as expected._

- _Tests are included for each business logic behavior and code is committed after each test passes._

- _Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state and follows best practices and coding conventions taught at Epicodus._

- _The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline._

### Project Objectives Further Exploration

- _Site is styled with CSS and images._

- _Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings._

- _Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details._

- _Offer a delivery option that then requires address information._
