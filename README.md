# Pizza Parlor

## by _**John Whitten**_

### _December 11, 2021_

#### _This is a web-based application wherein the user can order a pizza, select various toppings and sizes, and receive an order confirmation._

## Technologies Used

- _HTML_
- _CSS_
- _Bootstrap_
- _Javascript_
- _jQuery-3.6.0_

## Project Title: Pizza Parlor

## Description

#### _This is the fourth independent project for Epicodus._

#### _Project Prompt: Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost._

- _Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order._
- _Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size._
- _Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this. Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes._

## Project Objectives

- _Constructors and prototypes are used successfully._

- _Application works as expected._

- _Tests are included for each business logic behavior and code is committed after each test passes._

- _Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state and follows best practices and coding conventions taught at Epicodus._

- _The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline._

### Project Objectives Further Exploration

- _Site is styled with CSS and images._

- _Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings._

- _Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details._

- _Offer a delivery option that then requires address information._

## Tests

```
Describe: Pizza()

Test: "It should return a Pizza object with two properties for toppings and size"
Code: const myPizza = new Pizza(["anchovies", "pineapple"], "medium");
Expected Output: Pizza { toppings: ["anchovies", "pineapple"], size: "medium" }
Test passed!


Describe: Customer()

Test: "It should return a Customer object with three properties for name, phone number, and address"
Code: const customerOne = new Customer("John", "1234567890", "123 Yum Yum Lane, Hungryville, Oregon 12345");
Expected Output: Customer { name: "John", phone number: "1234567890", address: "123 Yum Yum Lane, Hungryville, Oregon 12345" }
Test passed!


Describe: Price()

  Calculate Price:
    • Pizza = $16 flate rate
    • Size: small + $1; medium + $8; large + $16; extra large + $24
    • Toppings: Mozarella + $2; Pepperoni + $2; Green Peppers + $2, Feta + $2, Sun Dried Tomatoes + $2, Roasted Garlic + $2

let total = 16;
  if (this.size === "extra large") {
    total += 24;
  } else if (this.size === "large") {
    total += 16;
  } else if (this.size === "medium") {
    total += 8;
  } else (this.size === "small") {
    total += 0;
  }

  return total



Test: "It should return a value calculated by adding the pizza size and the number of toppings"
Code: let totalPrice = new Price



Test: "It should return a value calculated by adding the pizza size and the number of toppings"
Code: let totalPrice = new Price
